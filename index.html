    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>Hello! I'm <strong>Cejie M. Hernandez</strong>, a passionate and detail-oriented web developer with a deep love for crafting digital experiences that are not just functional, but also visually compelling and user-centric. Ever since I discovered the endless possibilities of web development, Iâ€™ve been committed to learning and improving every day. My fascination with the web began with curiosityâ€”an eagerness to understand how websites worked beneath the surface. From building static HTML pages to developing interactive user interfaces with JavaScript, Iâ€™ve continually evolved my skills through self-learning, hands-on projects, and collaboration with other creatives. Today, Iâ€™m confident working across both the front-end and back-end, and I specialize in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python. I'm also diving deeper into full-stack development by exploring frameworks like React for dynamic front-end components and Node.js for powerful server-side logic. With a drive to continually level up, I am also exploring databases, deployment techniques, and UX/UI design to complete my skill set as a well-rounded developer.</p>

    <p>My approach to web development is centered around creativity and problem-solving. I believe that the best digital solutions are built through the seamless integration of design and functionality. I enjoy transforming complex ideas into sleek, responsive websites and applications that adapt to any screen and provide a delightful experience. When I take on a project, I put an emphasis on thoughtful architecture, clean and readable code, and intuitive design. I find joy in the small detailsâ€”smooth hover transitions, subtle animations, and accessibility features that make every interaction feel refined. Beyond coding, Iâ€™m also interested in futuristic UI/UX design, anime aesthetics, and motion-based interactions. These inspirations shape my personal style, and I often incorporate elements of sci-fi visuals, minimal layouts, and immersive effects into my work. Whether itâ€™s a personal project, a clientâ€™s vision, or a team collaboration, I always strive to produce work that is not only technically sound but also emotionally engaging and visually memorable.</p>

    <p>Outside of coding, Iâ€™m someone who thrives on curiosity, continuous learning, and self-improvement. I regularly watch tech tutorials, read articles about the latest trends in software development, and experiment with new tools and frameworks. Iâ€™m fascinated by the evolving nature of technology, especially the role of AI, interactive media, and immersive web experiences in shaping our digital future. I also enjoy graphic design, gaming, video editing, and storytellingâ€”skills that complement my development journey and allow me to explore creative expression across various mediums. My goal is to create digital experiences that feel alive, that spark interest, and that bring people value in their everyday lives. Whether Iâ€™m building a to-do list app, designing a futuristic interface, or developing a full-fledged portfolio, I pour my heart and focus into every line of code. With each project, I aim to push boundaries, challenge myself, and inspire others to see technology not just as a toolâ€”but as an art form.</p>
